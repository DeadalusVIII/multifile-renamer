# MultiFile Renamer
A desktop application for bulk file renaming.

Renaming files the way you want can sometimes be a bothersome task, especially if they are numerous and have to follow a certain logic or sequence. This small application allows a more controlled bulk file renaming than the one Windows offers. While many applications such as this can already be found throughout the Web, this application stands out for its simplicity, ease of use and accessibility though the potential of direct integration with the Windows Explorer context menu.
